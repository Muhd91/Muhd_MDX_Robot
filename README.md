Muhd_MDX_Robot
This project will simulate a 2-wheel diff robot in a Gazebo virtual
environment. Then build a map after familiarizing the robot with the obstacles around it using slam_gmapping node. Furthermore programming the robot using C++ to follow waypoints (goals).

EXTRA: using a separate package called (auto_move) in order to move the robot forward using python language.
